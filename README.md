Portfolio repo for the MIT course

Dear visitor,

Welcome to my portfolio repository!

I created this repository and its corresponding README file as part of my MIT course. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills and knowledge in various areas, including HTML/CSS, among others.

This portfolio will serve as an exercise for me to further improve my skills and deepen my knowledge. I hope you enjoy it and get an insight into my skills and work.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments about this portfolio or my skills. You can send a request through my MIT profile at https://classroom.emeritus.org/. Thank you for visiting and I hope you have fun browsing through my portfolio!
